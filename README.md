# Medical-Image-Analysis-for-classfication-of-Tumors
A tumor is a mass or lump of tissue that may resemble swelling. Not all tumors are
cancerous but it is a good idea to consult a doctor if one appears. We mainly deal
here with the concept of breast cancer. The method initially is preprocessing images
using color deconvolution to highlight stained objects.
Tumors when cancerous cause threatening organ tumors or cancer. Tumors can vary
in size from a tiny nodule to a large mass, depending on the type, and they can
appear almost anywhere on the body. Not all tumors resemble the cancerous
properties but it is always a good option to consult a doctor if any swelling or tumor
appears in a person's body.
In this project we will mainly concentrate on the types of breast cancer. The most
common types of breast cancer are: Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), Invasive Ductal
Carcinoma (IDC), Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC), Metastatic Breast Cancer
(MBC). Here we will mainly concentrate on Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) for our
project.
